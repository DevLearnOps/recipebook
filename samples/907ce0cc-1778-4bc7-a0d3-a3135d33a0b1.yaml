directions: "#### Step 0\nPut the dates in a heatproof bowl, cover with 150ml boiling\
  \ water, and leave to soak for 30 mins. Butter a 1-litre pudding basin and line\
  \ the base with baking parchment.\n\n#### Step 1\nTip half the butter, half the\
  \ treacle, the vanilla, 75g of the sugar and the cream into a pan set over a medium\
  \ heat. Cook for 4-5 mins, stirring, until the sugar dissolves. Turn up the heat,\
  \ bubble for 3 mins, then whisk in a pinch of salt. Pour a third of the sauce into\
  \ the basin.\n\n#### Step 2\nBeat the remaining butter, treacle, sugar and the eggs\
  \ together, then fold in the flour, bicarb, \xBC tsp salt, the dates and their soaking\
  \ liquid. Spoon into the basin and smooth the surface, leaving a 1cm gap from the\
  \ top. Cover with a double layer of baking parchment and foil, making a pleat in\
  \ the middle so the pud can expand. Secure with kitchen string.\n\n#### Step 3\n\
  Set the slow cooker to low. Sit the basin inside, then add boiling water so it comes\
  \ halfway up the basin. Cover and cook for 7-8 hrs. Run a knife around the edge\
  \ of the pudding and turn out onto a plate. Reheat the remaining sauce and pour\
  \ over. Serve with ice cream."
