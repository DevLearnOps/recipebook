directions: "#### Step 0\nHeat the slow cooker to low. Put the oil in a frying pan\
  \ over a medium-high heat. Season the chicken and fry, skin-side down, for 4-5 mins\
  \ until crisp. Turn and fry for 3-4 mins more until golden all over. Put on a plate\
  \ and set aside.\n\n#### Step 1\nTip the shallots into the pan and fry for 10 mins\
  \ over a medium heat until soft. Add the garlic and mushrooms and fry for 10 mins\
  \ more until the mushrooms are golden. Pour in the wine and bubble for a few minutes\
  \ until reduced by half. Stir in the tomato pur\xE9e, chopped tomatoes and herbs.\
  \ Season well and bring to a simmer. \n\n#### Step 2\nTip the sauce into the slow\
  \ cooker, and top with the chicken thighs (in one layer, if possible). Pour over\
  \ the chicken stock until the chicken thighs are covered, adding a little more if\
  \ needed. Cover and cook for 6-8 hrs until the sauce has thickened and the chicken\
  \ is tender. Transfer the chicken to a plate and bubble the sauce for a few minutes\
  \ more with the lid off, if you prefer a thicker sauce (you can only do this if\
  \ there\u2019s a reduce function on the slow cooker. If not, pour the sauce into\
  \ a pan and simmer until reduced). Remove the skin from the chicken before serving,\
  \ if you prefer. \n\n#### Step 3\nSprinkle over the parsley and serve the chicken\
  \ and sauce with buttery mash, jackets, pasta or small roast potatoes, if you like."
