directions: "#### Step 0\nHeat the butter, honey and 300ml water in a saucepan. Set\
  \ aside to cool to hand temperature.\n\n#### Step 1\nMix the flours, yeast and 1\xBD\
  \ tsp salt in a bowl. Pour in the warm liquid and mix with a wooden spoon, then\
  \ with your hands. Tip onto your work surface and knead for 10 mins or until springy.\
  \ Place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with oiled cling film and leave somewhere\
  \ warm to rise for 2 hrs or until doubled in size.\n\n#### Step 2\nFlour a large\
  \ baking tray. Tip the dough onto your work surface and knead to knock out the air\
  \ bubbles. Remove \xBC of the dough so that you have 2 pieces. Shape both pieces\
  \ of dough into smooth balls, put the large one on the baking tray then sit the\
  \ smaller ball on top. Using a well-floured handle of a wooden spoon, push through\
  \ the centre of the 2 balls of dough to stick them together. Cover with oiled cling\
  \ film and leave to rise for about 45 mins or until doubled in size. Heat oven to\
  \ 220C/200C fan/gas 7 and put a cake tin on the bottom shelf, with an empty shelf\
  \ directly above for the bread.\n\n#### Step 3\nRemove the cling film from the bread.\
  \ Brush all over with the egg, then sprinkle generously with seeds. Slash the edges\
  \ of the loaf a few times with a sharp knife to create a pattern. Open the oven\
  \ and pour a cup full of water into the cake tin \u2013 this will create steam and\
  \ give the loaf a crisp crust. Put the bread on the empty shelf and bake for 20\
  \ mins, then turn the oven down to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and bake for another 30 mins\
  \ until crisp and hollow-sounding when tapped on the base. Remove from the oven\
  \ and cool on a wire rack for at least 30 mins before eating."
