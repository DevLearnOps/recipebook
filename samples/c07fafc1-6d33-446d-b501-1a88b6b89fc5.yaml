  Fry the chorizo over a medium heat in a large saucepan or flameproof casserole dish
  for 5 mins or until it releases its oil and starts to char at the edges. Add the
  onion and fry for 5 mins more or until soft. Tip in the garlic and cook for 2 mins
  before stirring in the paprika and sundried tomatoes. Add the chicken thighs and
  fry for 2 mins each side until they are well coated in the spices and beginning
  to brown.


  #### Step 1

  Pour in the chopped tomatoes and stock, and turn the heat down. Cover and cook for
  40 mins until the chicken is falling apart and the sauce is thick. Stir the lemon
  juice through. Serve by piling spoonfuls of the ragu into hot jacket potatoes with
  parsley sprinkled over and a dollop of soured cream, if you like.'
