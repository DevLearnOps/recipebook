directions: "#### Step 0\nTip the flours, yeast and salt into a bowl. In a jug, mix\
  \ the honey with 250ml warm water, pour the liquid into the bowl and mix to form\
  \ a dough. Rye flour can be quite dry and absorbs lots of water, if the dough looks\
  \ too dry add more warm water until you have a soft dough Tip out onto your work\
  \ surface and knead for 10 mins until smooth. Rye contains less gluten than white\
  \ flour so the dough will not feel as springy as a conventional white loaf.\n\n\
  #### Step 1\nPlace the dough in a well oiled bowl, cover with cling film and leave\
  \ to rise in a warm place for 1-2 hrs, or until roughly doubled in size. Dust a\
  \ 2lb/900g loaf tin with flour.\n\n#### Step 2\nTip the dough back onto your work\
  \ surface and knead briefly to knock out any air bubbles. If using caraway seeds\
  \ work these in to the dough. Shape into a smooth oval loaf and pop into your tin.\
  \ Cover the tin with oiled cling film and leave to rise somewhere warm for a further\
  \ 1 \u2013 1.5 hr, or until doubled in size.\n\n#### Step 3\nHeat oven to 220C/200C\
  \ fan/gas 7. Remove the cling film and dust the surface of the loaf with rye flour.\
  \ Slash a few incisions on an angle then bake for 30 mins until dark brown and hollow\
  \ sounding when tapped. Transfer to a wire cooling rack and leave to cool for at\
  \ least 20 mins before serving"
