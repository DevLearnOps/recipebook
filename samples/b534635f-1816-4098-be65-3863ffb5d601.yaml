directions: "#### Step 0\nHeat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and line a baking tray\
  \ with baking parchment. Blitz the oats in a food processor until fine, then tip\
  \ into a large bowl along with the flour, bicarbonate of soda, \xBD tsp salt and\
  \ 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper. Quickly mix together to combine. Mix in 130g\
  \ of the cheese and all of the spring onions.\n\n#### Step 1\nMix the buttermilk\
  \ and mustard together in a jug, then pour this into the dry ingredients and use\
  \ a cutlery knife to quickly mix into a soft, shaggy dough. If the dough still looks\
  \ dry, add another 1-2 tbsp buttermilk. Turn the dough out on a floured surface\
  \ and knead briefly to just bring it together into a ball.\n\n#### Step 2\nTransfer\
  \ the dough to the prepared tray and flatten it slightly into a thick disc using\
  \ your palm. Use a sharp knife to cut a very deep cross into the top, then scatter\
  \ with the remaining cheese and a small handful of oats. Bake for 35-45 mins until\
  \ deeply browned and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. Leave to\
  \ cool on a wire rack before slicing and serving."
