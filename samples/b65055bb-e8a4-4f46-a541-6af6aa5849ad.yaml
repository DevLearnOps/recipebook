directions: '#### Step 0

  Heat the slow cooker to low and heat 1 tbsp oil in a pan. Brown the chicken in batches,
  transferring it to the slow cooker as you go. Add the remaining oil to the pan and
  fry the onions for 5 mins, or until just softened, then stir in the garlic and paprika
  and cook for another minute. Tip into the slow cooker, then swirl 100ml water around
  the pan and pour this in as well.


  #### Step 1

  Add the chipotle, passata, barbecue sauce, sugar and lime juice, then season and
  stir. Cover and cook for 6-8 hrs until the chicken is really tender. Using two forks,
  shred the chicken through the sauce. Serve in buns, taco shells, jacket potatoes
  or over rice, with coriander leaves, chillies and guacamole, if you like.'
