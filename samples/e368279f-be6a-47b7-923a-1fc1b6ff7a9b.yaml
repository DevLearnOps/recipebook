directions: "#### Step 0\nTip the potatoes into a pan, cover with hot water from the\
  \ kettle and add a pinch of salt. Simmer for 15-20 mins until tender, then drain\
  \ and leave to steam-dry.\n\n#### Step 1\nMeanwhile, warm the butter in a heavy-based\
  \ pan over a low heat. Add the flour and stir until you have a paste. Gradually\
  \ whisk in 200ml milk until you have a thick white sauce. Simmer for 3-4 mins, stirring.\
  \ Season, then stir in the mustard and half the cheese, and continue to stir until\
  \ the cheese has melted. Fold in the fish, peas and kale, and cook for 8 mins more,\
  \ or until the kale wilts, the fish is just cooked and the prawns are starting to\
  \ turn pink.\n\n#### Step 2\nHeat the grill to medium-high. Mash the potatoes with\
  \ the spring onion and 1 tbsp milk. Fold in the remaining cheese and season well.\
  \ \n\n#### Step 3\nTip the filling into a heatproof dish and spoon the cheesy mash\
  \ on top, swirling it with a fork until the filling is completely covered. Sprinkle\
  \ over the parmesan and grill for 10-15 mins until the pie is golden and bubbling.\
  \ Serve with a green salad, if you like. Uncooked pie, well covered in the dish,\
  \ will keep in the freezer for up to three months."
