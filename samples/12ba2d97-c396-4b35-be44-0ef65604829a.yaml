  Rinse the rice under cold running water, rubbing with your fingers to remove any
  excess starch. Cook following pack instructions, then drain well.


  #### Step 1

  Bring another pan of water to a simmer. Cook the green beans for 2 mins, then transfer
  to a bowl with a slotted spoon and set aside. Boil the eggs in the pan for 7 mins,
  then drain and transfer to a bowl of cold water to cool.


  #### Step 2

  Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Fry the onions
  for 10-15 mins until golden. Add the garlic, curry powder, turmeric and bay leaves
  and cook for 1 min more. Stir in the spinach, tomatoes and a splash of water and
  cook for another 5 mins until the spinach has wilted.


  #### Step 3

  Fold the cooked rice and green beans through the spinach mixture and cook for a
  few minutes until the rice is warmed through. Drain and gently peel the eggs, then
  slice in half.


  #### Step 4

  Top the rice mixture with the eggs, coriander and chilli. Serve the vedgeree with
  the lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over.'
