directions: "#### Step 0\nSeason the brisket all over with salt and pepper. Heat the\
  \ vegetable oil in a frying pan (or use the sear function on your slow cooker) and\
  \ sear the meat all over until browned. Transfer to a plate. Add another drizzle\
  \ of oil, if needed, and fry the onions with a pinch of salt until lightly golden,\
  \ about 12 mins. Sprinkle over the flour, stir until well-mixed, then pour in the\
  \ ale and scrape the bottom of the pan to pick up any browned bits. Tip everything\
  \ into the slow cooker (if using a frying pan).\n\n#### Step 1\nAdd the yeast or\
  \ beef extract, sugar and vinegar, then the beef and herbs. Top up with stock until\
  \ the brisket is just over half submerged. Cover and cook for 7-8 hrs on low until\
  \ tender. Remove the meat from the slow cooker and cover to keep warm. Use the reduce\
  \ or simmer function on your slow cooker and simmer for 10-15 mins until the gravy\
  \ has thickened to your liking. If yourslow cooker doesn\u2019t have a simmer function,\
  \ pour the gravy into a pan and simmer on the hob until thickened. Add a pinch more\
  \ salt, sugar or a dash more vinegar if needed. If you like your gravy to be extra-thick,\
  \ mix the cornflour with a splash of cold water, then add to the pan and bubble\
  \ for a few minutes.\n\n#### Step 2\nJust before you remove the meat from the slow\
  \ cooker, start on the mash. Cook the potatoes in a pan of boiling salted water\
  \ for 20 mins until very tender when pressed. Drain and steam-dry for a few minutes\
  \ before mashing with the horseradish, butter and cr\xE8me fra\xEEche. Scatter with\
  \ parsley to serve. Cut the brisket into wedges and serve with the gravy and mash."
