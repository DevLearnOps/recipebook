directions: "#### Step 0\nMix the flour, yeast and salt in a large bowl and make a\
  \ well in the middle. Measure 350ml warm water and pour most of it into the well.\
  \ Mix the flour and water together with your fingers or a wooden spoon until combined\
  \ into a slightly wet, pillowy, workable dough \u2013 add a splash more water if\
  \ necessary.\n\n#### Step 1\nTip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead\
  \ for at least 10 mins until smooth and elastic. This can also be done in a tabletop\
  \ mixer with a dough hook.\n\n#### Step 2\nShape the dough into a large, tight ball\
  \ and sit the ball on a square of baking parchment. Use the parchment to lift the\
  \ dough into your slow cooker, cover and set the slow cooker to high. Leave for\
  \ 2 hrs.\n\n#### Step 3\nLift the bread out using the parchment. The bottom should\
  \ be crusty and the top should be springy, not soft. (If you have a digital cooking\
  \ thermometer, the middle of the loaf should be 90C.) If it isn\u2019t ready, return\
  \ to the slow cooker for 15 mins and test again \u2013 it could take up to 2 hrs\
  \ 30 mins.\n\n#### Step 4\nThe bread won\u2019t get a significant crust or golden\
  \ colour in the slow cooker. Once cooked, you can leave it to cool, or put in the\
  \ oven at 240C/220C fan/gas 9 for 5-10 mins to get some colour."
