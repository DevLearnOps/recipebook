  Bring a pan of lightly salted water to the boil. Add the broccoli and boil for 5
  mins. Scoop out with a slotted spoon and set aside.


  #### Step 1

  Put the pasta in the same pan and cook following pack instructions. Meanwhile, tip
  the broccoli into a food processor with the pine nuts, basil, garlic, parmesan and
  oil, and blitz until smooth. Season with black pepper and a little salt (the pancetta
  is very salty).


  #### Step 2

  Set a frying pan over a medium heat and cook the pancetta for 2 mins. Add the tomatoes
  and cook for 3 mins, or until softened. Toss the pasta with the broccoli pesto,
  tomatoes and pancetta, and loosen with a splash of pasta water, if needed. Spoon
  into bowls and serve.'
