directions: '#### Step 0

  Mix 500g strong white flour, 2 tsp salt and a 7g sachet of fast-action yeast in
  a large bowl.


  #### Step 1

  Make a well in the centre, then add 3 tbsp olive oil and 300ml water, and mix well.
  If the dough seems a little stiff, add another 1-2 tbsp water and mix well.


  #### Step 2

  Tip onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for around 10 mins.


  #### Step 3

  Once the dough is satin-smooth, place it in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with
  cling film. Leave to rise for 1 hour until doubled in size or place in the fridge
  overnight.


  #### Step 4

  Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Knock back the dough (punch the air out
  and pull the dough in on itself) then gently mould the dough into a ball.


  #### Step 5

  Place it on the baking parchment to prove for a further hour until doubled in size.


  #### Step 6

  Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7.


  #### Step 7

  Dust the loaf with some extra flour and cut a cross about 6cm long into the top
  of the loaf with a sharp knife.

  Bake for 25-30 mins until golden brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped underneath.
  Cool on a wire rack.'
