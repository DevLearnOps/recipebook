directions: "#### Step 0\nWeigh the flour out into a large bowl. Rub in the softened\
  \ butter using your fingers until the mixture resembles fine crumbs. Add the yeast\
  \ and sugar to one side of the bowl, and the salt on the other. Using a spatula,\
  \ mix everything together to combine.\n\n#### Step 1\nMake a well in the centre\
  \ and pour in 300ml warm water. Using the spatula, mix until you have a rough dough.\
  \ Tip the dough out onto the work surface and bring together into a large mound.\n\
  \n#### Step 2\nKnead the dough by hand for 10-15 mins or in a stand mixer fitted\
  \ with the dough hook for 6-8 mins on high speed until smooth and elastic. Oil a\
  \ large bowl and drop in the dough. Cover and leave to prove somewhere warm for\
  \ 1 hr until doubled in size.\n\n#### Step 3\nOnce the dough has doubled, tip it\
  \ out onto the work surface and flatten it to remove any air pockets. Sprinkle over\
  \ the halloumi in an even layer, then the chipotle flakes. Fold the dough over and\
  \ knead in the cheese and chilli until evenly distributed. Line a large baking tray\
  \ with baking parchment.\n\n#### Step 4\nTuck the edges of the dough into the centre\
  \ until you have a neat dough ball. Transfer this to the tray, seam-side down, cover\
  \ with a clean tea towel and leave to prove for another hour until doubled in size\
  \ again. You will know the dough is ready when you poke it with your finger \u2013\
  \ if it springs back slowly and a small indent remains, it\u2019s ready.\n\n####\
  \ Step 5\nHeat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 7 with a roasting tin on the bottom\
  \ shelf. Uncover the dough and lightly sieve some flour over it. Cut a cross into\
  \ the top using the tip of a sharp serrated knife.\n\n#### Step 6\nPut the loaf\
  \ on its tray into the roasting tin, then pour some hot water into the tin around\
  \ the tray to create steam while baking. This will give you a crisp crust. Bake\
  \ for 20-25 mins until the loaf is golden and sounds hollow when you tap the base.\n\
  \n#### Step 7\nRemove from the oven and and leave to cool on a wire rack. Cut into\
  \ slices and enjoy with lashings of butter."
