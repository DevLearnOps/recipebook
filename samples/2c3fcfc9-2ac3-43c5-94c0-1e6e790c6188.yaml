directions: '#### Step 0

  Tip the flour into a large bowl with the yeast and 2 tsp salt, and mix together.
  Add 2 tbsp of the olive oil, then slowly pour in 350ml lukewarm water, continuing
  to mix until you have a slightly sticky dough. Tip the dough out onto a lightly
  floured work surface, scraping around the sides of the bowl. Knead for 5-10 mins
  until the dough is soft and less sticky, then put in a clean bowl, cover with a
  tea towel and leave to prove for 1 hr until doubled in size.


  #### Step 1

  Generously oil a shallow rectangular baking tin (ours was 20 x 30cm). Tip in the
  dough, then use your hands to stretch it out until it reaches the corners of the
  tin. Cover with a clean tea towel and leave to prove for a further 35-45 mins. Meanwhile,
  tip the tomatoes into a bowl, season, add the oregano and drizzle with 1 tbsp olive
  oil. Toss together and set aside.


  #### Step 2

  Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/ gas 7. Press the tomato halves evenly into the into
  the dough, then do the same with the olives. Crumble over the feta, then lightly
  press everything down again using your fingertips. Drizzle with 1 tbsp olive oil
  and scatter with sea salt, then bake for 25-30 mins until deep golden and puffed
  up. While the bread is still hot, drizzle over the remaining 1 tbsp olive oil. Leave
  to cool completely in the tin, then slice. You can wrap it in the tin to take on
  a picnic, or wrap individual squares. Will keep wrapped, or in an airtight container,
  for up to two days.'
