directions: '#### Step 0

  Pour the milk into a large pan and add the flour and butter. Set over a medium heat
  and whisk continuously until you have a smooth, thick white sauce. Remove from the
  heat, add the mustard, most of the cheese (save a handful for the top), peas and
  parsley.


  #### Step 1

  Meanwhile, boil the pasta in a large pan of water following pack instructions until
  just cooked. Drain.


  #### Step 2

  Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Tip the pasta into the sauce and add half
  the fish, stir everything together then tip into a large baking dish. Top with the
  rest of the fish, pushing it into the pasta a little, then scatter with the remaining
  cheese. Bake for 30 mins until golden, then serve with salad, if you like. Can be
  chilled and eaten within three days or frozen for up to a month. Defrost in the
  fridge, then reheat in a microwave or oven until piping hot.'
