directions: "#### Step 0\nDay 1:To begin your starter, mix 50g flour with 50g tepid\
  \ water in a jar or, better still, a plastic container. Make sure all the flour\
  \ is incorporated and leave, semi-uncovered, at room temperature for 24 hrs.\n\n\
  #### Step 1\nDay 2:Mix 50g flour with 50g tepid water and stir into yesterday\u2019\
  s mixture. Make sure all the flour is incorporated and leave, semi-uncovered, at\
  \ room temperature for another 24 hrs.\n\n#### Step 2\nDay 3:Mix 50g flour with\
  \ 50g tepid water and stir into yesterday\u2019s mixture. Make sure all the flour\
  \ is incorporated and leave, semi-uncovered, at room temperature for another 24\
  \ hrs.\n\n#### Step 3\nDay 4:You should start to see some activity in the mixture\
  \ now; there should be some bubbles forming and bubbling on top. Mix 50g flour with\
  \ 50g tepid water and stir into yesterday\u2019s mixture. Make sure all the flour\
  \ is incorporated and leave, semi-uncovered, at room temperature for another 24\
  \ hrs.\n\n#### Step 4\nDay 5:The mixture should be very active now and ready for\
  \ making your levain. If it\u2019s not bubbling, continue to feed it on a daily\
  \ basis until it does. When it\u2019s ready, it should smell like yogurt.\n\n####\
  \ Step 5\nYou now have a starter, which is the base to the bread. You\u2019ll need\
  \ to look after it, but naming is optional! Keep it in the fridge (it will stay\
  \ dormant) and 24 hrs before you want to use it, pour half of it off and feed it\
  \ with 100g flour and 100g water. Leave it at room temperature and it should become\
  \ active again. The longer the starter has been dormant, the more times it will\
  \ need to be refreshed \u2013 the process of pouring off half the starter and replacing\
  \ it with new flour and water \u2013 to reactivate. If your starter is ready to\
  \ use, a teaspoonful of the mixture should float in warm water.\n\n#### Step 6\n\
  For the levainMix 1 tbsp of the starter with 100g flour and 100g water (this is\
  \ the same process as feeding the starter, but you should do this in a new, separate\
  \ bowl, keeping the original starter as back-up, as this is the mixture you'll use\
  \ to bake your bread). Leave the levain for 8 hrs at room temperature until it becomes\
  \ active. When ready, a teaspoonful of the mixture should float in warm water.\n\
  \n#### Step 7\nFor the breadPour 600g tepid water into the levain and stir with\
  \ a rubber spatula to mix together \u2013 don\u2019t worry if there are unmixed\
  \ bits of levain. Tip in the flour and mix everything together with a rubber spatula\
  \ to make a rough dough, ensuring all the flour is incorporated evenly and that\
  \ there are no dry bits up the side of the bowl. Cover and leave somewhere warm\
  \ for at least 30 mins, or up to 4 hrs.\n\n#### Step 8\nSprinkle over the salt and\
  \ add 50g water to the dough. Pinch and scrunch the salt and water through the dough\
  \ with your hands. If the dough goes stringy (like old chewing gum), just keep working\
  \ it until it\u2019s one smooth texture. Leave for another 15 mins.\n\n#### Step\
  \ 9\nWet your hands, grab the dough from one side and stretch it over itself, then\
  \ repeat with the other side. This stretching technique helps develop the gluten.\
  \ Pick the dough up and curl it around onto itself, then cover and leave for another\
  \ 20-30 mins. Repeat this process two more times (three in total), then leave the\
  \ dough for another 2-3 hrs until it\u2019s risen by about 30% and looks bubbly\
  \ and soft.\n\n#### Step 10\nUsing a rubber spatula, scrape the dough out onto a\
  \ lightly floured work surface and split in two. Fold each piece onto itself to\
  \ create a ball, then leave uncovered for 30 mins. The dough balls will spread during\
  \ this time.\n\n#### Step 11\nDust two bread-proving baskets generously with flour.\
  \ Scrape one of the balls of dough off the work surface, then fold it onto itself\
  \ to create a tight ball that\u2019s trapped in all the air. Lift the ball into\
  \ a basket, seam-side up, then transfer to the fridge to chill overnight, or for\
  \ up to 18 hrs. Repeat with the other dough ball.\n\n#### Step 12\nHeat the oven\
  \ to 240C/220C fan/gas 9 and put a lidded casserole dish in the oven to heat. Cut\
  \ a sheet of baking parchment into a square slightly larger than the base of one\
  \ of the loaves. Carefully remove the hot casserole dish from the oven and remove\
  \ the lid. Invert one loaf onto the baking parchment, then, working quickly, score\
  \ the top at an angle. Use the corners of the parchment to lift the loaf into the\
  \ casserole dish. Cover with the lid and bake for 30 mins, then carefully uncover\
  \ and continue to bake for another 10 mins (or longer for a darker finish). Carefully\
  \ lift the bread out of the dish using a spatula, transfer to a wire rack and leave\
  \ to cool to room temperature before slicing. Repeat with the second loaf."
