directions: "#### Step 0\nFry the onion and celery in 1 tbsp oil over a low heat until\
  \ they start to soften \u2013 about 5 mins. Add the carrots, bay and thyme, fry\
  \ for 2 mins, stir in the pur\xE9e and Worcestershire sauce, add 600ml boiling water,\
  \ stir and tip everything into a slow cooker. Crumble over the stock cubes or add\
  \ the stock pots and stir, then season with pepper (don\u2019t add salt as the stock\
  \ may be salty).\n\n#### Step 1\nClean out the frying pan and fry the beef in the\
  \ remaining oil in batches until it is well browned, then tip each batch into the\
  \ slow cooker. Cook on low for 8-10 hrs, or on high for 4 hrs.\n\n#### Step 2\n\
  If you want to thicken the gravy, mix the cornflour with a splash of cold water\
  \ to make a paste, then stir in 2 tbsp of the liquid from the slow cooker. Tip back\
  \ into the slow cooker, stir and cook for a further 30 mins on high. Stir in the\
  \ parsley and season again to taste. Serve with mash, if you like. Leave to cool\
  \ before freezing."
