directions: "#### Step 0\nTo make the tomato sauce, heat the olive oil in a saucepan.\
  \ Add the onions, garlic and carrot. Cook for 5-7 mins over a medium heat until\
  \ softened. Turn up the heat a little and stir in the tomato pur\xE9e. Cook for\
  \ 1 min, pour in the white wine, then cook for 5 mins until this has reduced by\
  \ two-thirds. Pour over the chopped tomatoes and add the basil leaves. Bring to\
  \ the boil then simmer for 20 mins. Leave to cool then whizz in a food processor.\
  \ Will keep, cooled, in the fridge for up to three days or frozen for three months.\n\
  \n#### Step 1\nTo make the white sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan, stir in the\
  \ plain flour, then cook for 2 mins. Slowly whisk in the milk, then bring to the\
  \ boil, stirring. Turn down the heat, then cook until the sauce starts to thicken\
  \ and coats the back of a wooden spoon. Will keep, cooled, in the fridge for up\
  \ to three days or frozen for three months.\n\n#### Step 2\nHeat the oven to 200C/180C\
  \ fan/gas 6. Lightly oil two large baking trays and add the peppers and aubergines.\
  \ Toss with the olive oil, season well, then roast for 25 mins until lightly browned.\n\
  \n#### Step 3\nReduce the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Lightly oil a 30 x 20cm ovenproof\
  \ dish. Arrange a layer of the vegetables on the bottom, then pour over a third\
  \ of the tomato sauce. Top with a layer of lasagne sheets, then drizzle over a quarter\
  \ of the white sauce. Repeat until you have three layers of pasta.\n\n#### Step\
  \ 4\nSpoon the remaining white sauce over the pasta, making sure the whole surface\
  \ is covered, then scatter over the mozzarella and cherry tomatoes. Bake for 45\
  \ mins until bubbling and golden."
