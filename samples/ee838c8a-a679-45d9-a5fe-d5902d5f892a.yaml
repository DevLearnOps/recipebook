directions: "#### Step 0\nHeat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Halve any large potatoes\
  \ so they\u2019re all roughly the same size. Put in a pan of water, bring to the\
  \ boil and simmer for 8-10 mins until tender. Drain.\n\n#### Step 1\nTip the potatoes\
  \ into a large roasting tray to sit in one snug layer. Drizzle with 1 tbsp oil,\
  \ season and add the lemon zest, garlic, thyme and bay. Toss to coat the potatoes.\
  \ Use a potato masher to gently crack each potato, being careful not to break them\
  \ up too much. Place the chicken on top, rub with the rest of the oil and the paprika,\
  \ then season. Roast for 45 mins until golden brown and cooked through.\n\n####\
  \ Step 2\nMeanwhile, make the creamed spinach. Boil the kettle and tip the spinach\
  \ into a colander. Pour over the boiling water to wilt the leaves. Leave to cool.\n\
  \n#### Step 3\nHeat the butter in a pan. Add the onion and cook for 8-10 mins until\
  \ softened. Stir through the garlic for another minute, then the flour for another\
  \ minute. Pour in the milk, a little at a time, stirring and adding more until you\
  \ have a smooth sauce. Bring to a simmer and stir continuously until the sauce has\
  \ thickened.\n\n#### Step 4\nSqueeze any liquid out of the spinach, then roughly\
  \ chop. Add to the sauce along with the nutmeg. Season to taste. Transfer to a baking\
  \ dish, top with the cheese, and bake for 15 mins until golden.\n\n#### Step 5\n\
  Cover the chicken and rest for 5 mins. Set aside 2 legs to cool before chilling\
  \ for lunch tomorrow. Serve the rest (1 full leg each per adult, a drumstick or\
  \ thigh each for the children) with the potatoes and spinach alongside some carrots."
