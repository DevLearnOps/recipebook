directions: "#### Step 0\nPut the caster sugar, golden syrup, clotted cream, vanilla\
  \ and a pinch of sea salt flakes in a slow cooker. Stir until well-mixed and smooth.\
  \ Cook on high for 4-5 hrs, stirring every 30 mins, or until it\u2019s a golden\
  \ caramel colour and looks glossy. If your slow cooker works with the lid off, cook\
  \ uncovered to speed up cooking. It will take about 5 hrs if using a multi-function\
  \ cooker with a locked lid that requires you to keep opening and stirring it.\n\n\
  #### Step 1\nOil a 20cm baking tin and line with baking parchment. Remove the bowl\
  \ of the slow cooker carefully and set on a heatproof mat or chopping board. Mix\
  \ with a wooden spoon or spatula vigorously for 10-15 mins to cool the fudge and\
  \ to break up any large sugar crystals. The fudge will thicken as it cools and start\
  \ to look matte. Tip into the tin and use a spatula to smooth the surface. Sprinkle\
  \ with a little more salt and chill until set, about 1 hr. Cut into chunks. Will\
  \ keep for five days in an airtight container."
